# Messi vs Ronaldo game
This is an assigment project for Android Application Development course, in Afeka - the academic college of Engineering in Tel Aviv.

# Overview
The "Messi vs Ronaldo" app is an obstacle game where the user controls Messi and needs to avoid obstacles represented by Ronaldo.
As Messi navigates the game, encountering obstacles reduce life's hearts, while encountering cups rewards points. 
At the end of the game, the user's score is displayed. Additionally, the app keeps track of the user's top 10 records, displaying them along with their respective locations. 
This adds a competitive element to the game, allowing users to strive for better scores and compare their performance with others.

# Features
The "Messi vs Ronaldo" app offers several features to enhance the gaming experience:

**Top 10 Records:** The game maintains a leaderboard of the top 10 records, allowing users to see their rank and score on the screen. This fosters competition among players to achieve higher scores.

**Google Map Integration:** The app records the location of each player who achieves a top 10 score. Users can view a Google map within the app that displays markers indicating where these players played the game. 
Control Options: Players have the flexibility to choose between using buttons or sensors to control the Messi character in the game. Sensor mode allows players to tilt their device left or right to maneuver the character, offering a more interactive and immersive gaming experience.

**Fast or Slow Mode:** Users can select between playing the game in fast or slow mode. Fast mode increases the difficulty and excitement of the game, while slow mode offers a more relaxed and easier gameplay experience. This customization caters to players with different skill levels and preference
